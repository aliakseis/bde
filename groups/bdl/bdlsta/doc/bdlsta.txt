@PURPOSE: Provide basic statistical computations.

@MNEMONIC: Basic Development Library STAtistics (bdlsta)

@DESCRIPTION: The 'bdlsta' package provides basic statistical computations.  At
 the moment, this package contains a component, 'bdlsta_moment', for
 calculating mean, variance, skew, and kurtosis.  Another component,
 'bdlsta_linefit', is for calculating linear squares line fit.

/Hierarchical Synopsis
/---------------------
 The 'bdlsta' package currently has 2 components having 1 level of physical
 dependency.  The list below shows the hierarchical ordering of the components.
 The order of components within each level is not architecturally significant,
 just alphabetical.
